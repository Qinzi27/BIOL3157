### ENH

- Added new alignment quality measures as apps, and the ability to invoke them
  from the Alignment.alignment_quality() method. The new apps are the
  Information content measure of Hertz and Stormo (denoted `ic_score`), a
  variant on the the sum of pairs measure of Carillo and Lipman
  (denoted `sp_score`), and the log-liklelihood produced by the cogent3
  progressive-HMM aligner (denoted `cogent3_score`). If these apps cannot
  compute a score (e.g. the alignment has only 1 sequence), the return a
  `NotCompleted` instance. Instances of that class evaluates to `False`.
