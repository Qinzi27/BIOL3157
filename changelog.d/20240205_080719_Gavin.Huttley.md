### ENH

- Now support python3.12 ðŸš€
- We drop support for python3.8
- Pin numpy version to < 2 until we can test against released version.
- AnnotationDb.subset() method. Returns a new instance matching provided
  conditions.
- SeqView.parent_start, SeqView.parent_stop properties report position
  on original sequence. These help keep track of the segment on original
  after slicing operations. They always **return** plus strand orientation.
- SeqView offset argument added to constructor
- SeqView.copy() method. Supports slicing the original data (and
  recording the offset).
- Sequence.parent_coordinates() returns parent_start, parent_stop, strand
  values from underlying SeqView. strand is +/- 1, which is relative to
  the original sequence.
- AnnotationDb methods now expect the strand argument to have value "+"/"-"
  or None.
- make_seq() returns a seq as is if it's already the correct molecular
  type. This preserves the AnnotationDb attribute.
