### ENH

- The tree_align() function now uses new approximation method for faster
  estimation of distances for a obtaining guide tree. This is controlled by
  the approx_dists argument. The additional argument iters can be used to
  do multiple iterations, using genetic distances computed from the alignment
  produced by the preceding iteration to generate the new guide tree.
  
  If approx_dists is False, or the moltype of chosen model is not a nucleic acid
  compatible type, distances are computed by the slower method of performing
  all pairwise alignments first to estimate the distances.
