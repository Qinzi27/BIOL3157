### Deprecations

- Reverse slicing of Alignment and ArrayAlignment are now consistent
  with reverse slicing of a string. Previously reverse slicing an
  Alignment instance, e.g. `aln[5:1]` would reverse complement a
  nucleic acid object, but fail if it was any other molecular type.
  This behaviour was different to ArrayAlignment. For both objects, use
  a normal slice and reverse complement, e.g. `aln[1:5].rc()`.
