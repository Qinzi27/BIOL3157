### ENH

- Major rewrite of the mutual information based coevolution statistics. These are
  most easily accessed from the `Alignment.coevolution()` method. The rewrite delivers
  several orders of magnitude perofmance improvement by using `numba.jit` compiled
  functions based on numpy arrays, plus caching of intermediate calculations.
  The speed of the resampled Mutual Information calulation is now near identical to
  that for the simpler MI and NMI statistics.
- The coevolution statistics can now be run in parallel on a single machine.
  This is most easily accessed by setting `<alignment>.coevolution(parallel=True)`.
  The parallelisation is at the level of chunks of position pairs.

### Deprecations

- All the old coevolution functions and statistics are marked for removal
  by the last major release of 2024. Their implementations were pre-2010!,
  and so not well suited to current data sizes. The mutual information based
  statistics are retained, but rewritten to be much faster (see the Enhancement
  section).
- The old coevolution example document is removed as its out-of-date.
