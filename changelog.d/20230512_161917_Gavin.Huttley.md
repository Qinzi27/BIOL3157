### ENH

- Added SequenceCollection.distance_matrix() method. This method provides
  a mechanism for k-mer based approximation of genetic distances
  between sequence pairs. It is applicable only to DNA or RNA moltypes.
  Sequences are converted into 10-mers and the jaccard distance is computed
  between them. This distance is converted into an estimate of a proportion
  distance using a 10-th degree polynomial. (That polynomial was derived from
  rgression to distances from 116 mammal alignments.) The final step is applying
  JC69 to these approximated proportin distances.
