cogent3_ is a software library for genomic biology. It is a comprehensive framework for manipulation of genomic sequence data and for conducting molecular evolutionary analyses. It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities. Of particular note are our non-stationary Markov substitution models. These include `non-stationary nucleotide <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25503772>`_,

and `non-stationary codon <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28175284>`_ models. Plus, the ability to manipulate biological sequences by their annotations.
