## Cogent3

This is a descendant of [PyCogent](https://github.com/pycogent/pycogent.github.com). While there is much in common with PyCogent, the amount of change has been substantial, motivating a new name Cogent3. This name has been chosen because `cogent` was always the import name (dating back to 2004!) and it's python 3 only.

## What's New?

A massive amount!

We integrated many of the new developments on modelling of non-stationary processes published by the Huttley lab over the last decade.

We have implemented a `cogent3.app` module which contains a very different approach to using the capabilities. Notably, a functional programming style interface lowers the barrier to entry for using cogent3's advanced capabilities. Documentation is coming...

Importantly, the app interface should be considered as alpha level code.

## What's Changed?

There are massive changes to the library since PyCogent version 1.9.

Please check the wiki for a list of the major API changes, but note that as of August 23, 2019 that Wiki is now very much out-of-date.

We will update as soon as possible.

## Installation?

We will be up on PyPI as soon as the documentation is written, until then it's [download a tarball](https://github.com/cogent3/cogent3) and pip install from that, or clone.

## Documentation

Cogent3 documentation is on [readthedocs](https://cogent3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
